# KingsChallenge

Coding Task: The Kings
You will develop a small C#/.NET Core project (e. g. Console App) that will fetch a
list of English monarchs from an online data source and produce various
statistics about them.


You need make the project self-contained, such that it fetches and processes the
list of monarchs in the same process.While the task is simple, please apply your daily coding
style. Don't overcomplicate things and try to keep your code short.


You can find the data here:

09563bc0c4b318132c7a738e679d4f984ef0048/kings


You need to fetch the data, convert it into a local representation (you could use
Newtonsoft Json) and answer the following questions (you could use LINQ):


1. How many monarchs are there in the list?

3. Which monarch ruled the longest (and for how long)?

5. Which house ruled the longest (and for how long)?
   
7. What was the most common first name?
   
Once complete, please send us the implementation in one C# file, e. g. Program.cs
If you have used other dependencies than Newtonsoft Json, please let us know.
